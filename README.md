## Hi there 👋 I am Vedran

I'm a Full-Stack Developer working remotely from cozy Rovinj, Croatia.

Over the past few years, I’ve gained experience across backend and frontend development, contributing to scalable systems and responsive interfaces. From robust APIs to intuitive user experiences, I love tackling challenges that bring ideas to life.

These days, I’m working as a Software Developer at 👁️🐝Ⓜ️ iX (IBM iX), helping create solutions that are both efficient and delightful to use.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on...

Refining my portfolio to showcase impactful projects and skills in React, Flutter, and Spring Boot, tailored for my next career move.


When I’m not coding, you’ll find me shooting hoops, exploring the latest tech trends, or enjoying the natural beauty of the Croatian coast. 🏀 📖 🌊
